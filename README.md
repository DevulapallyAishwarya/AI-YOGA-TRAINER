# AI-YOGA-TRAINER
People of all ages can benefit from the physical and mental health benefits of yoga.
Yoga poses must be performed correctly especially, without an instructor to avoid any harm to 
the bones, muscles, and ligaments. Thus, the usage of Artificial Intelligence and machine 
learning with the help of image processing will help to give feedback to the performer even 
without a live instructor. The proposed system is intended to instruct users to perform the yoga 
pose correctly and also correct them if they do it incorrectly. The feedback is given to the user 
in form of text and audio which can help the practitioner to prevent injuries and also increase 
the benefits of performing the yoga pose. The data set of different Yoga poses is created by 
taking various images from the internet. With the help of OpenCV and media pipes, the data 
points are figured out from each image from the webcam. This is now loaded into a 
Convolution neural network based deep learning model (CNN) which helps to identify errors 
in the pose and produce the error percentage and gives the user the required feedback in the 
form of text or audio desired output whose classification accuracy is about 95%.
